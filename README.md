# Syntecxhub_House_price_prediction

🏠 House Price Prediction

Internship Project 1 - Syntecxhub

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning techniques. 
A Linear Regression model is built to estimate housing prices based on selected housing features.

📂 Dataset Features
> The dataset contains the following columns:
> country – Country where the property is located
> city – City of the property
> property_type – Type of property (Apartment, Villa, etc.)
> furnishing_status – Furnished / Semi-Furnished / Unfurnished
> property_size_sqft – Size of property in square feet
price – Target variable (House price)
constructed_year – Year when property was built
previous_owners – Number of previous owners
rooms – Number of rooms
bathrooms – Number of bathrooms
garage – Garage availability (Yes/No or 0/1)
garden – Garden availability (Yes/No or 0/1)
crime_cases_reported – Number of crime cases reported in the area
legal_cases_on_property – Legal cases associated with the property



🎯 Objective
- Load and clean housing dataset
